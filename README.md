# NPM build utility for FuseTools

Wrangles NPM packages for you so you can use them in your Fuse projects.

`npm install -g nfuse`

1. Make a package.json next to your .unoproj. 
2. Run `nfuse` in that directory
3. Use your NPM packages in Fuse. Easy peasy (ideally).

nfuse wraps the `fuse` command as well: `nfuse preview` is the same as `fuse preview` 

Under constant development. YMMV.
